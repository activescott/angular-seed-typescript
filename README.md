# angular-seed-typescript

Angular rocks. TypeScript rocks. Node.js is handy. This project is an attempt to make it easier to get started with all three. 

This project is similar to the venerable angular-seed project but has the following important differences:

* It uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
* In addition to to the client-side Angular-based component of the app, this project adds a server-side Node.js-based component.
* It is more approachable and simpler to get started with because:
 * It removes some "extra" things like testing frameworks (I like tests, but I'm trying to keep this approachable).
 * There are more comments through config files, build scripts, to help the newcomer or hobbyist programmer understand what's going on and to make changes.

## Rant:
For all of Angular's goodness, is complicated to get started with. There are a lot of concepts to understand in order to be productive. Couldn't it be more approachable? I can't confidently answer that yet, but this project is an experiment to try and make it better.

## Getting Started
Run build.sh on a mac or linux box. If you're doing this on windows, use cygwin or write a comparable build.bat file for the project and submit a pull request.
