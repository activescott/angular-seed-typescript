# angular-seed-typescript

Angular rocks. TypeScript rocks. Node.js is handy. This project is an attempt to make it easier to get started with all three. 

This project is similar to the venerable angular-seed project but has the following important differences:

	* It uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
	* In addition to to the client-side Angular-based component of the app, this project adds a server-side Node.js-based component.
	* It is more simple to get started with, but slightly less comprehensive for experienced and advanced AngularJS programmers who will benefit from testing tools like karma and protractor. 

Personally, I greatly value TDD and BDD testing but for some reason I find angular-seed striking me as overwhelmingly complicated just requiring to much knowledge of too many different things. 


## Rant:
I'm not fond incredible complexity that that Angular, bower, karmar, grunt, node, etc. have imposed on development. Surely this needn't be more complicated than cross-platform C++, COM/ActiveX development, Java, and the .NET development worlds I've spent over a decade in. So why is it so? I don't yet have an answer that I'm confident in, but this project is an experiment to try and make it better.


## Getting Started
Run build.sh on a mac or linux box. If you're doing this on windows, use cygwin or write a comparable build.bat file for the project and submit a pull request.
